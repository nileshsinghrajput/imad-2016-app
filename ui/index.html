                            <dd>DATE: 16<sup>th</sup> December,2012<br>
                                    The heading mentioned above is enough to throw an idea of what I am going to talk about.This incident not only shook the very roots of mankind but also proved how disguise a man can be just for satisfying his physical needs.That girl being victimised was continuing on ventilator, struggling between life and death got punishment for something she was not responsible.The only mistake she did was the bus she boarded that night unprecedented with the fact that the wounds she is going to get won't heal till her death.This barbaric tragedy at last found its way to justice but again it left all of us with a question...ARE INDIAN ROADS SAFE ENOUGH FOR WOMEN ??? <br>

                                 Malala Yousafzai the youngest Nobel Prize laureate, sounds too cool but what see suffered is too horrible and terrific to explain.A girl who fought for her rights and was shot by Taliban.Her journey began just after she took her wits up and her father taught never to step behind against injustice.She became rigid on her intention that <u>"If pens won't be offered to children,guns are going to adore the innocent hands"</u>,and thereafter she became a  torch bearer for the rest.After being shot by the militants, she continued on ventilator for several days and her signs of recovery showed a new hope to the society, a clear proclamation that NOT ALL VOICES CAN BE SUPPRESSED, NOW IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE<br>

                            The most brutal face of terrorism came to sight on the day when 141 people were killed in an open fire by a militant's group including 132 children.Just in a few minutes of instance they turned the whole military school into a graveyard.Their parents were totally unknown to the fact that they are giving a final sendoff to their children and yes <u>THEY WENT TO SCHOOL & NEVER CAME BACK</u>. The news I heard about an eight years boy whose body was found headless gave me a jerk of goosebumps but his mother identified her lad before she suffered a heart stroke.For us maybe it was just a news of terrorist attack but the families who lost their children for them <u>THOSE SMALLEST COFFINS WERE THE HEAVIEST</u>.
